Within each of the demo scenes you will find examples the system being used and its parameters being changed.

Each scene, when run, can be controlled as follows
- SPACE will run generation again. For scenes with fixed random scenes, this will change nothing visually.
- R will toggle the visualization of RoomNodes. RoomNodes look very similar to the placeholder prefabs used in this demonstration, but differ by colour.
- P will log the number of hallways generated by each LevelGenerator.

HallsOnly will showcase generation without considering special rooms. This is the simplest way to use the system.

SpecialRooms showcases generation with a number of special rooms considered. This is the intended use of the system.

DesiredIters showcases the effect of running the system for a varying number of generation iterations.

ItersPerSpecial showcases the effect of increasing the number of iterations before reserving a spot for a special room.

RecentPoolSize showcases the effect of changing the number of most recently placed rooms the algorithm will use in its growth selection process.

ImportedAsset is an example using rooms that are more alike to what a game would use. Assets are taken from here:

The colour scheme for RoomNodes is as follows:
- Cyan rooms are reserved spots for special rooms
- White rooms are hallways
- The yellow room is the first room used placed in generation

The colour scheme for PLACED rooms is as follows:
- Blue rooms are instantiated special rooms.
- Gray rooms are instantiated hallways.
- The red room is the placeholder special room considered as a "starting" room.
